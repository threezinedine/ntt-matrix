# ntt-very-super-micro-dnn
Matrix operation library

This project is inspired by [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn), but [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn) is too slow and consumes a lot of RAM. However, they dared to name it "tiny," so I think calling my project something still modest is quite humble.

(đang cảm thấy khiêm tốn ko hề nhẹ 🤏).
